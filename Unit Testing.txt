I would write a class that would test 'LoadSurface()' by loading various surfaces, 
'DrawSurface' by drawing various surfaces, 'device' by using it invarious ways, 
the 'backbuffer' by drawing to it and displaying the result, the keyboard inputs by logging the keys pressed,
the controller by logging the buttons pressed and the axis of the joysticks, 
the mouse by logging the position and the buttons pressed.
